## Prerequisites

Before setting up SKizify, ensure that your development environment includes:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Database: PostgreSQL instance (local or remote)
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- (Optional) Docker for containerized deployments

## Install Dependencies
### Using npm:
```bash
npm install
```
### Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```

## Setup Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You can start by copying the example file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Then, edit `.env` to include:
- `PORT`: The port number for the server (e.g., 3000).
- `DB_URI`: Your database connection string.
- `JWT_SECRET`: A strong secret for JWT-based authentication.
- `TURN_SERVER_URL` & `TURN_SERVER_CREDENTIALS`: (If applicable) Configuration for TURN services.

## Configuration
The configuration files are organized to separate environment-specific settings from code:
- **.env File**: Contains sensitive keys and variables.
- **Config Modules**: Located in the `config/` directory, these modules load environment variables and set defaults for development, testing, and production environments.

Be sure to update these configurations according to your deployment environment.

## Running Locally
### Development Mode
Start the development server with live reload:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Production Build
### Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
### Start the Server
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

## Testing
SKizify includes unit and integration tests to maintain code quality. Run the test suite with:
```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```
For continuous integration, consider integrating these tests into your CI/CD pipeline.

## Deployment
### Docker Deployment
SKizify provides a Dockerfile for containerized deployments:

#### Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t skizify .
```
#### Run the Container
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:3000 --env-file .env skizify
```

### Cloud Providers
For cloud deployments (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud):
- Ensure your environment variables are securely managed.
- Use load balancing and auto-scaling options as needed.
- Integrate with cloud-based databases and storage solutions.
